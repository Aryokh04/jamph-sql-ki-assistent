    - This folder is not the root of any single project.
    - When asked to work on projects nested in this structure, look for project/.github/copilot/instructions.md for specific instructions on that project.
  dont:
    - Add code comments unless explicitly asked to.
    - Create documentation files unless explicitly asked to.
    - Use verbose and overly polite language.
